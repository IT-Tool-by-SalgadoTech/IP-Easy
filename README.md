IP-Easy
The Visual IPv4 Subnetting Assistant for Network Students and Engineers

IP-Easy is a comprehensive web-based tool that simplifies the process of IPv4 subnetting, VLSM planning, and network visualization. It combines technical precision with a modern, accessible interface designed for students, instructors, and professionals who work with IP addressing and network configuration.

The application calculates network parameters such as subnet masks, wildcard masks, broadcast addresses, and usable host ranges across the full IPv4 range—from /1 to /32, including specialized handling for /31 (RFC 3021) and /32 loopback or single-host addresses. Each subnet result is accompanied by binary representation, class identification, and automatic wildcard computation for ACL and OSPF design.

A built-in VLSM planner allows users to input host counts (for example, “5, 2, 5, 1, 1”) and instantly generate subnet assignments optimized for address efficiency. Optional controls automatically add gateway addresses or growth margins, providing realistic configurations for network engineering tasks.

The latest version introduces Auto IP Discovery, which detects the user’s current public IP address automatically, and a location map module that displays the approximate geographic position of the detected IP—enhancing both educational and diagnostic use cases.

All operations occur entirely in the browser, requiring no backend services. The interface is lightweight, responsive, and compatible with GitHub Pages for instant deployment as a self-contained web application.
